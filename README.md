# Superstore Real-Time Data Pipeline: Kafka to Cloud Analytics

![Architecture Diagram](Dashboard/architecture.png)

Welcome to my **Superstore Real-Time Data Pipeline Project**! This repository showcases my advanced data engineering skills, building an end-to-end pipeline that ingests real-time sales data from Kafka, processes it locally in Python, stores it in PostgreSQL, and migrates it to AWS Redshift for analytics—visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The project highlights my expertise in real-time data processing, cloud migration, ETL optimization, and data visualization, completed efficiently with best practices in mind.

## Project Overview

This project modernizes a Superstore data workflow by integrating real-time data ingestion, daily updates, and cloud-based analytics. It demonstrates my ability to design scalable, automated pipelines and deliver actionable business insights, completed in a structured, efficient manner within a tight timeline.

- **Data Ingestion**: Consumes real-time sales data from Kafka, processed in Python, and stored in PostgreSQL.
- **Daily Updates**: Exports today’s sales data to CSV files, transferred to AWS S3, and processed via EMR.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Transforms data into a Redshift star schema using PySpark on EMR for optimized analytics.
- **Visualization**: Builds an interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time insights into sales trends and distributions.
- **Visualization for Today's Data**: Builds an interactive Flask dashboard for real-time insights into sales data of today's sold items.

## Dataset

The Superstore dataset originates from Kafka streams, processed into PostgreSQL tables, and filtered for daily sales. The schema includes:

- **Tables**:
  - `orders`: `order_id`, `order_date`, `ship_date`, `ship_mode`, `customer_id`, `product_id`, `sales`, etc.
  - `customers`: `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `segment`, `country`, `city`, `state`, `postal_code`, `region`.
  - `products`: `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`, `sub_category`.

---

## Architecture

The data pipeline follows a robust, scalable architecture:

1. **Source**: Kafka streams for real-time sales data.
2. **Processing**: Local Python scripts process data and insert into PostgreSQL.
3. **Daily Export**: PostgreSQL exports today’s data to CSV files in the `Data` folder.
4. **Staging**: AWS S3 (`s3://superstore-migration-007/raw/`) stores CSV files.
5. **ETL**: Amazon EMR with PySpark transforms and loads data into Redshift.
6. **Target**: AWS Redshift (star schema for analytics).
7. **Visualization**: Power BI connected via ODBC to Redshift.

## PostgreSQL Schema

The on-premises PostgreSQL schema stores initial data:

![PostgreSQL Schema](Schemas/postgresql_relation.png)

- **Structure**: Normalized tables (`orders`, `customers`, `products`) linked by foreign keys.
- **Daily Export**: Uses `COPY` queries to extract today’s data into CSVs.

---

## Redshift Schema

Data is transformed into an optimized star schema in Redshift for analytics:

![Redshift Schema](Schemas/redshift_relation.png)

- **Dimension Tables**:
  - `time_dim`: `time_key (IDENTITY)`, `order_date`, `year`, `quarter`, `month`, `day`.
  - `customers_dim`: `customer_key (IDENTITY)`, `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `segment`, `country`, `city`, `state`, `postal_code`, `region`.
  - `products_dim`: `product_key (IDENTITY)`, `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`, `sub_category`.
- **Fact Table**:
  - `sales_facts`: `sales_key (IDENTITY)`, `order_id`, `time_key (FK)`, `customer_key (FK)`, `product_key (FK)`, `sales`.
- **Optimizations**: `DISTKEY` and `SORTKEY` (e.g., `DISTKEY(customer_key)`, `SORTKEY(time_key)` on `sales_facts`) for performance.

---

## ETL Pipeline

The ETL pipeline, built with PySpark on Amazon EMR, ensures efficient data transformation and loading:

- **Extract**: Reads daily CSV files from S3 (`customers.csv`, `products.csv`, `orders.csv`).
- **Transform**: Converts data into a star schema, linking `sales_facts` to dimensions using natural keys (`order_date`, `customer_id`, `product_id`). Redshift auto-generates `IDENTITY` keys.
- **Load**: Writes to Redshift using the `spark-redshift` connector, storing only the latest records.

**Code**: See [`etl.py`](Scripts/etl.py) for the full implementation.

## Dashboard

The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard, delivering real-time insights:
